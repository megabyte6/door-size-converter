# Door size converter

## About
This is a quick calculator that I made to convert centimeters to inches. It includes up to 16ths of an inch and whether it rounds up or down.

The name for the repo comes from the initial purpose for this project. It was originally used to convert cabinet door sizes as they would be measured in centimeters but getting them made would require the measurements to be in inches.
